# Cave

> The desktop home for your Coven.

Cave is the native workspace for [OpenCoven](https://github.com/OpenCoven/coven) — a place to talk to your familiars, watch their tools, inspect their memory, and follow the work they're doing across sessions.

A familiar isn't a chat window. It has a name, a purpose, a memory, a toolset, and a place in your day. Cave is where that lives.

## What it is

- A Tauri 2 desktop app (macOS / Windows / Linux)
- A Next.js 16 frontend (App Router, Turbopack, Tailwind v4)
- Full markdown rendering with syntax highlighting (Shiki)
- Integrated terminal (xterm.js) alongside the familiar interface
- Talks to the local `coven` daemon over `~/.coven/coven.sock`
- Local-first. Your familiars, your memory, your machine.

## What it isn't

- Not a replacement for [CastCodes](https://github.com/OpenCoven/cast-codes) — Cave is its sibling. CastCodes is the terminal and code workspace; Cave is the desktop home for the Coven itself.
- Not a cloud service. There's no upstream to call.

## Features

- **Familiar rail** — persistent sidebar with all your named agents, glyphs, and live health status
- **Chat** — threaded conversations with full markdown, inline code, syntax-highlighted blocks, and copy buttons
- **Inspector pane** — dig into memory, tool calls, and agent internals without leaving the app
- **Board view** — kanban-style overview of active work across familiars
- **Delegation cards** — see what your familiars are doing and hand off tasks
- **Schedules & reminders** — manage cron jobs and one-shot reminders from the UI
- **Plugins** — install skills and plugins directly from the app
- **HomeComposer** — universal intent surface on cold start; describe what you need and let the Coven route it
- **Inbox** — cross-familiar notification feed with snooze and quick-reply
- **System tray** — always accessible, even when the window is closed
- **Cross-platform fatal error dialogs** — startup failures surface clearly on macOS, Windows, and Linux

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
scripts/install-git-hooks.sh    # one-time: enable secret-scanning pre-commit
pnpm tauri dev                  # native window, hot-reloads Next.js
pnpm dev                        # browser-only at http://localhost:3000
```

You'll need the `coven` daemon running locally so Cave has something to talk to. See [OpenCoven/coven](https://github.com/OpenCoven/coven) for setup.

### Pre-commit hook

`scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` blocks commits that introduce env files,
private keys, signing material, agent scratch state, or inline tokens
(AWS / Stripe / Slack / GitHub PAT / OpenAI / Anthropic / Telegram /
Bearer / PEM private-key blocks). Patterns mirror `src/lib/redact.ts`.
Bypass a confirmed false positive with `git commit --no-verify`.
