 * Refine suggestions power the artifact "Refine" space: a couple of one-tap
 * starting points so the user never faces a blank box. There are two rows —
 *
 *   • DEFAULT_REFINE_SUGGESTIONS — always-useful optimizations that apply to
 *     any artifact (visual polish, accessibility, motion).
 *   • generateRefineSuggestions(code, kind) — context-aware ideas derived from
 *     what's actually in the artifact (buttons without hover states, a form
 *     with no validation, a fixed-width layout, etc.).
 *
 * Both return plain instruction strings; tapping one drops it into the refine
 * textarea so the user can run it as-is or edit first. Heuristics are cheap
 * string scans — no parsing, no familiar round-trip — so they're instant.
